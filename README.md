# Steins;Gate Textractor

Only works for Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0. This is a proof of concept,
can easily be adapted to copy to clipboard for standard texthooker such
as ITHVNR or NextHooker. Character mapping was provided by
[CommitteeOfZero](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/SciAdv.Net/blob/master/src/SciAdvNet.SC3/Data/SteinsGateZero/Charset.utf8),
all other work was done by me. I believe this works for all versions of
Steins;Gate and 0, no guarantees though. Steam version seems to have a different character mapping. This version was generated through OCR, as well as [Geniussmit](https://github.com/Geniusssmit) carefully sifting through the results for errors.

### Build Instructions

Made with VS2017, requires any windows SDK, otherwise should compile
out-of-the-box.

### Use Instructions

Running this program should be all you need to do, make sure that
mages_charset.bin is in the same directory as the executable.
It will print any new text bubbles to console, and will print e-mail
sender, subject, and body upon opening said e-mail. For s;g0 it prints
the full conversation to console.

Depending on the version you are playing, you will need to swap out the character set (mages_charset.bin) for the correct one.
The actively used charset is whichever charset file is named `mages_charset.bin`, so swapping out a different version only involves renaming the desired charset file to `mages_charset.bin`

- Japanese steam version of Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0: rename `mages_charset_steam.bin` to `mages_charset.bin`
- Chinese steam version of Steins;Gate: rename `mages_charset_steam_chinese.bin` to `mages_charset.bin`
- Japanese steam version of Steins;Gate Linear Bounded Phenogram: rename `mages_charset_lbp.bin` to `mages_charset.bin`
- Japanese steam version of Steins;Gate My Darling's Embrace: rename `mages_charset_darling.bin` to `mages_charset.bin`

`charsetconvert.py` can be used to extract existing `.bin` character sets or create new character sets, provided you have obtained the character set in raw text. 

Otherwise, do not touch any of the `mages_charset.bin` files.

> Make sure to close and reopen after closing the game, as it doesn't reopen on its own.
